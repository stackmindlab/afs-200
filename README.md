# 🧠 AFS-200: Python OOP & Web Development (Bryan University)

📚 **Course Focus**:  
Learned object-oriented programming (OOP) with Python and applied those concepts to web development using Flask and Django. Explored API integration, Flask routing, templating with Jinja2, and secure app structures.

🕒 **Duration**: 8 Weeks  
✅ **Completion**: Weeks 1–4 fully completed 
🔧 **Tech**: Python, Flask, OOP, APIs, Requests module, HTML templates

## 🎲 Yahtzee Project (Week 4)

Built a simple command-line Yahtzee game using Python classes and logic:

- Created a `Die` class supporting any number of sides  
- Methods: `__init__()`, `roll()`, `getCurrentFaceValue()`, `showDieFace()`  
- Rolled five dice and displayed results  
- Printed "YAHTZEE!" if all five dice matched  
- Bonus: Displayed emojis for each face value 🎲  

```python
(3) (2) (6) (4) (1)
(5) (5) (5) (5) (5)
YAHTZEE!

### 📌 Reinforced Skills (Yahtzee Project Summary)
- Created a `Die` class with support for variable sides  
- Built a terminal-based Yahtzee game using Python OOP  
- Printed `"YAHTZEE!"` when all dice showed the same value  
- Bonus: Displayed emoji faces for each roll 🎲  
- **Result**: Strengthened core Python logic in a fun, hands-on way
